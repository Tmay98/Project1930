Grocer Together Web App developed by BCIT CST Students: Jacky Zheng, Tommy May, Dhruv Gandhi.
Our Web-app enables users to find groups around them and conveniently bulk buy groceries together. This saves money by bulk purchasing and reducing waste, so you can buy extra groceries to save money without worrying about extra food going to waste. It also encourages a sense of community by meeting up with your neighbors and interacting with them. You can create a profile and join/create groups to find people who are willing to get groceries with you.

Inside our project directory are the webpages, along with a css folder, js folder, and images folder.
